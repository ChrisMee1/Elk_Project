This is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my Cybersecurity Class.

Most of the scripts are used to configure the cloud servers with different docker containers.

The final setup was 2 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with jump box and a server running an ELK stack container
